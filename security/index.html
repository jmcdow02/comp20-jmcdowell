	<h1>Security Assessment of Dan Callahan’s Web Application</h1>
	<p>by James McDowell, 4/24/15</p>

	<h2>Introduction</h2>
		<p>This document assesses the security of Dan Callahan’s Maurader’s Map heroku web application at <a href="http://secret-badlands-5595.herokuapp.com/">http://secret-badlands-5595.herokuapp.com/</a>. The app stores records of each user’s login name, location, and check-in time in a MongoDB database. In this report, 3 security vulnerabilities of his application are listed.</p>

	<h2>Methodology</h2>
		<p>At first, “black-box testing” was used to primarily assess a few issues, such as cross-site scripting, with cURL.</p>
		<p>Next, Dan’s source code was viewed for “white-box testing”, to confirm and identify other suspected security flaws.</p>
