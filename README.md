The purpose of this git repository is to hold and organize all of my personal
projects in one location. 

My favorite assignment of the COMP20 course was Assignment 4. I tested the 
security of one of my classmates' earlier assignments and wrote a report 
on which aspects were not secure. I enjoyed working on it because I was 
supposed to put myself in the position of someone looking for vulnerabilities,
so I could get a better picture of what security issues I need to implement
and account for in the future.

I've grown a considerable amount from day 1 of this course. At the beginning, 
I didn't know a single thing about computer networks or how the internet
works. I hadn't heard of the word "git". Now, I have a detailed understanding
of the web, internet, and web programming. 

The most important thing I learned in this course was to learn how to learn.
This course was designed for the students to do a lot of research by 
themselves, which was quite new to me. One example is that the only security
risk mentioned in class was XSS, so I had to research other areas of 
security vulnerabilities in order to complete a report on someone's project
security. Another example is that we needed to learn how to use Javascript
basically on our own. We were only taught the basic layout of the language,
but not any of the syntax.

Now that I've completed this course, I'd like to delve deeper into the topic
of user interfaces. I learned that I enjoy working with the front-end side of 
web programming.
