Assignment 2: Maurader's Map

by: james mcdowell
date: 3/13/15

Correctly implemented: Sends and retrieves locations of everyone. 
Displays info windows for everyone. It has their title and distance.

Not correctly implemented: Distances for everyone are the same; it's 
only correct for one student. 
Display window for my own icon has no info in it. 
I don't know why either of these things are happening :(
Also, my files are in the wrong repository -- I emailed Ming about this. 

I collaborated with Danielle Zelin and Andrew Cavallaro.

I spent about 9 hours completing this assignment.
