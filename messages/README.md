All aspects appear to have been correctly implemented. 

I collaborated a little bit with Laura Brooks. 

I spent about 3-4 hours completing this project.

It's not possible to request data from a different origin or my local machine using XMLHttpRequest. The requests conform to the browser's same-origin policy. This means, only requests that are served from the same domain will succeed. 
The protocol, port, and host must be the same for the javascript page and the resource page (json) in order to successfully request the data.
